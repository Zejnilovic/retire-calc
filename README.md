# Retirement Savings Calculator

A comprehensive React-based retirement planning tool that helps users estimate how much they need to save monthly to achieve their desired retirement income. Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, featuring full internationalization support (English/Czech) and advanced financial modeling.

## What It Does

This calculator provides **inflation-adjusted** (real terms) retirement planning with sophisticated financial modeling:

- **Target Capital Calculation**: Shows both today's purchasing power and future dollar amounts needed at retirement
- **Monthly Savings Requirements**: Calculates required monthly contributions
- **Scenario Analysis**: Compare base, optimistic, and pessimistic scenarios
- **Tax & Fee Modeling**: Accounts for investment fees, capital gains taxes, and withdrawal taxes
- **Two Calculation Modes**: Deterministic and Monte Carlo simulation
- **Bilingual Interface**: Full English and Czech localization with currency support
- **Educational Content**: Comprehensive help sections and tooltips

## Features

### Internationalization
- **Languages**: English and Czech with full UI translation
- **Currencies**: EUR, USD, CZK with locale-aware formatting
- **Educational Content**: Localized help sections, tooltips, and explanations

### Calculation Modes
- **Deterministic**: Fixed assumptions with three scenarios (base/optimistic/pessimistic)
- **Monte Carlo**: Stochastic simulation with volatility modeling and success probability

### Retirement Models
- **Withdrawal Rate Model**: Based on sustainable withdrawal rates (e.g., 4% rule)
- **Amortization Model**: Fixed retirement horizon with complete capital depletion

### Key Inputs
- Personal: Current age, retirement age, current assets
- Economic: Inflation rate, nominal returns, volatility
- Costs: Investment fees, tax rates on gains and withdrawals
- Goals: Desired monthly withdrawal, withdrawal rate or retirement horizon

### Outputs
- Required monthly savings (in today's money)
- Target retirement capital (both real and nominal amounts)
- Future value of current assets (both real and nominal amounts)
- Monte Carlo success probability

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Internationalization**: i18next + react-i18next
- **State Management**: React Context (LocaleContext, DarkModeContext)
- **Deployment**: Static hosting ready (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

- **Czech** (`cs`): Complete interface, help text, and tooltips

### Supported Currencies  
- EUR (‚Ç¨), USD ($), CZK (Kƒç) with proper locale formatting

### Translation Keys
All user-facing text uses translation keys organized by feature:
- `section.*` - Form section titles
- `labels.*` - Input field labels  
- `tooltips.*` - Help text and explanations
- `results.*` - Results display text
- `info.*` - Educational content
- `options.*` - Dropdown options

## Financial Models

### Real vs Nominal Values
The calculator displays both perspectives for complete transparency:
- **Real (Today's Money)**: Inflation-adjusted purchasing power
- **Nominal (Future Money)**: Actual dollar amounts you'll see at retirement

### Real Returns Calculation
All calculations use **real returns** (inflation-adjusted) to express results in today's purchasing power:

```
Real Return = (1 + Nominal Return) / (1 + Inflation) - 1
```

### Tax and Fee Modeling
- Investment fees reduce gross returns
- Capital gains taxes apply to net positive returns  
- Withdrawal taxes reduce net retirement income

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Uses Box-Muller transform for normal distribution
- Bisection search to find required contribution for target success rate
- Models both accumulation and withdrawal phases with volatility

## Educational Features

### InfoSections Component
- **About this calculator**: Explains the tool's purpose and modes
- **How to interpret results**: Defines key terms and metrics  
- **Quick tips**: Practical advice for realistic assumptions
- **Disclaimer**: Clarifies educational vs. advisory nature

### Comprehensive Tooltips
Every input field and result metric includes helpful explanations:
- Technical definitions of financial terms
- Practical guidance on reasonable input ranges  
- Context about how each parameter affects results

## Usage Example

1. **Set Personal Details**: Age 35, retire at 65
2. **Define Goals**: ‚Ç¨3,000 monthly withdrawal in today's money
3. **Economic Assumptions**: 2.5% inflation, 6% nominal returns
4. **Choose Model**: 4% withdrawal rate or 30-year finite horizon  
5. **Review Results**: Required monthly savings and success probability
2. **Define Goals**: 45,000 CZK monthly withdrawal in today's money
3. **Economic Assumptions**: 2.5% inflation, 6% nominal returns
4. **Choose Model**: 4% withdrawal rate or 30-year finite horizon
5. **Review Results**: Required monthly savings and success probability

## Configuration
